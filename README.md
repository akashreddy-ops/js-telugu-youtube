🚀 Practicing JavaScript in GitHub Codespaces 🖥️
I’ve started practicing JavaScript in GitHub Codespaces, a powerful cloud-based development environment. It allows me to write, test, and run JavaScript code directly in my browser without any local setup!

📌 Why GitHub Codespaces?
✅ Instant Setup – No need to install dependencies, everything runs in the cloud.
✅ VS Code Integration – Full-fledged coding experience with extensions & debugging.
✅ Seamless Collaboration – Easily share and work on projects with teammates.
✅ Runs Anywhere – Code from any device, anytime!

💡 What I’m Practicing in JavaScript?
🔹 Core JavaScript concepts (Functions, Arrays, Objects, etc.)
🔹 DOM Manipulation & Event Handling
🔹 Asynchronous Programming (Promises & Async/Await)
🔹 Small projects & problem-solving
